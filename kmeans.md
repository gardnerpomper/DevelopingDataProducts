## Description

Kmeans is a method of clustering data points together. The idea is to get clusters of points that are each closer to the center of its cluster than to the center of any other clusters.

The main limitation of K-means clustering is that you have to decide how many clusters you want ahead of time. That many points are then scattered through the space and the algorithm iteratively calculates the distance of all the other points to the random centers to make the assigments. It then repeats until it is stable (i.e. all the points stay in the cluster they are assigned to)

There is a sample app for this one. Click on the Sample App tab.
