## Description
In the case of a discrete probability distribution of a random variable X, the mean $\mu$ is equal to the sum over every possible value weighted by the probability of that value; that is, it is computed by taking the product of each possible value x of X and its probability P(x), and then adding all these products together
$$\mu = \sum x P(x)$$
