## Description

Latex is a very powerful document formatting system, but the part that is in widest use is the way of representing and rendering mathmatical formula. Simple examples:

\forall x \in X, \quad \exists y \leq \epsilon: $\forall x \in X, \quad \exists y \leq \epsilon$

\alpha : $\alpha$

This topic has an app too, where you can type something in and see what happens
